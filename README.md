# Displaying GIFs with Python
Using the Packages PIL, Tkinter and Pyglet we are able to display GIFs
## Using Tkinter
Tkinter is included with standard Linux, Microsoft Windows and macOS installs of Python so its not required to install it alternatively
## Using Pyglet
Pyglet is not included so you need to install it, using:
``` 
pip install pyglet==1.2.4
```
